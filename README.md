  Personal Website of Adam Mihajlovic
</h1>

Personal Website made to show my work resume in a more beautiful format. It uses the framework Gatsby for the front-end which is based on react but with styled-components. For the back-end, it's using strapi to manage the content of this website in relation with cloudinary to manage media and postgres to host the data itself.

The front-end of the website is currently hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) and the back-end is hosted on a home-server via http. To view it, go to [home.adammihajlovic.ca/admin](home.adammihajlovic.ca/admin) but login information is needed to access the interface.

For more information please feel free to contact me with my information provided on the website: [adammihajlovic.ca](adammihajlovic.ca)

## üöÄ Quick start (To run this locally)

1.  **Prerequisites**

    Install both Gatsby's and Strapi's CLI to run the servers.

    ```shell
    # installation
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    npm install -g strapi
    
    # verify installation
    gatsby-cli -v
    strapi -v
    ```

1.  **Environment variables**

    Navigate to the `/server` folder and make sure you have a `.env` file containing the following:

    ```shell
    APP_KEYS=""
    HOST=127.0.0.1
    PORT=1338
    JWT_SECRET=""
    ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=""
    API_TOKEN_SALT=""
    SENDGRID_API_KEY=""
    
    CLOUDINARY_NAME=""
    CLOUDINARY_KEY=""
    CLOUDINARY_SECRET=""

    DATABASE_HOST=""
    DATABASE_PORT=
    DATABASE_NAME=""
    DATABASE_USERNAME=""
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=""
    ```
    
    When this is done, navigate back to the source folder and go to `/client` and make sure you `.env` file contains the following:

    ```shell
    STRAPI_TOKEN=""
    GATSBY_STRAPI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1338
    ```

1.  **Installing dependencies and building project**
  
    Start by making sure everything is up-to-date.
    Both in the `/server` and the `/client` folder, run
    
    ```shell
    # install dependencies
    npm install
    
    # build application
    npm run build
    ```

1.  **Running the back-end**

    Start by running the back-end (Strapi) by running the following command in the `/server` folder:
    
    ```shell
    # start in production mode 
    npm run start
    
    # OR
    # start in development mode (with schema modifications enabled)
    npm run develop
    ```
    Your Strapi content-manager should now be running at `http://localhost:1338`!

1.  **Running the front-end**

    Then to run the front-end (Gatsby), run the following command in the `/client` folder:
    
    ```shell
    # start in production mode 
    npm run start
    
    # OR
    # start in development mode (with auto-reload)
    npm run develop
    ```
    
    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project (Front-end).

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

7.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

8.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

9. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

10. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
